-- A JuvixAsm program is a set of JuvixAsm functions. Every function has an
-- associated Symbol, a fixed (i.e., known at compile time) number of arguments, a
-- fixed temporary stack size, and a fixed maximum local value stack height (see
-- Interpreter/RuntimeState.hs).

-- See the file Interpreter/RuntimeState.hs for a description of JuvixAsm runtime

data Instruction
  = -- | An instruction which takes its operands from the two top stack cells,
    -- pops the stack by two, and then pushes the result.
    Binop Opcode
  | -- | Convert the top stack cell to a string. JAV opcode: 'show'.
    ValShow
  | -- | Convert a string on top of the stack into an integer. JVA opcode:
    -- 'atoi'.
    StrToInt
  | -- | Push a value on top of the stack. JVA opcode: 'push <val>'.
    Push Value
  | -- | Pop the stack. JVA opcode: 'pop'.
    Pop
  | -- | Print a debug log of the object on top of the stack. Does not pop the
    -- stack. JVA opcode: 'trace'.
    Trace
  | -- | Dump the stacktrace. JVA opcode: 'dump'.
    Dump
  | -- | Interrupt execution with a runtime error printing the value on top of
    -- the stack. JVA opcode: 'fail'.
    Failure
  | -- | Computes the number of expected arguments for the closure on top of the
    -- stack, pops the stack and pushes the result on top of the stack. JVA
    -- opcode: 'argsnum'.
    ArgsNum
  | -- | Preallocate memory. This instruction is inserted automatically before
    -- translation to JuvixReg. It does not occur in JVA files.
    Prealloc InstrPrealloc
  | -- | Allocate constructor data with a given tag. The n arguments (the number n
    -- determined by the constant tag) are popped from the stack and stored at
    -- increasing offsets (stack[0]: field 0, stack[1]: field 1, ...,
    -- stack[n-1]: field n-1). The data is pushed on top of the stack. JVA
    -- opcode: 'alloc <tag>'.
    AllocConstr Tag
  | -- | Allocate a closure for the given function symbol. n = allocClosureArgsNum
    -- indicates the number of function arguments available (strictly less than
    -- the number of arguments expected by the function -- known functions can
    -- take zero arguments, but closures are required to take at least one). The
    -- n function arguments are popped from the stack and stored in the closure
    -- at increasing offsets. The result is pushed on top of the stack. JVA
    -- opcode: 'calloc <fun> <int>'.
    AllocClosure InstrAllocClosure
  | -- | Extend a closure on top of the stack with more arguments. n =
    -- extendClosureArgsNum indicates the number of arguments to extend the
    -- closure with -- it must be less than the number of arguments expected by
    -- the closure. Pops the closure from the stack, pops n additional arguments
    -- from the stack and extends the closure with them in increasing order,
    -- then pushes the extended closure on top of the stack. JVA opcode:
    -- 'cextend <int>'.
    ExtendClosure InstrExtendClosure
  | -- | Call a function given by an immediate constant Symbol or a closure on top
    -- of the stack. Creates a new activation frame for the function. The n =
    -- callArgsNum function arguments are popped from the stack and stored at
    -- increasing offsets (offset 0: top of stack) in the argument area. The
    -- return address is pushed on the global call stack. If the callType is
    -- CallClosure, then the closure is fetched from the top of the stack, the
    -- arguments stored in the closure are transferred to the argument area in
    -- increasing offset order, and then the supplied callArgsNum arguments are
    -- popped from the stack and transferred to the argument area in increasing
    -- order. JVA opcode: 'call <fun>' or 'call $ <int>'
    Call InstrCall
  | -- | Same as `Call`, but does not push the call stack, discarding the current
    -- activation frame instead. JVA opcode: 'tcall <fun>' or 'tcall $ <int>'
    TailCall InstrCall
  | -- | 'CallClosures' and 'TailCallClosures' are like 'Call' and 'TailCall'
    -- with 'CallClosure' call type, except that (1) they either call or extend
    -- the closure depending on the number of supplied arguments
    -- (callClosureArgsNum) vs the number of expected arguments fetched at
    -- runtime from the closure, and (2) if the number of expected arguments is
    -- smaller than the number of supplied arguments, then the result of the
    -- call must be another closure and the process is repeated until we run out
    -- of supplied arguments. With 'TailCallClosures', if the last operation is
    -- a call then it is a tail call, and if the last operation is a closure
    -- extension, then an implicit 'Return' is executed after it. JVA opcodes:
    -- 'ccall <int>', 'tccall <int>'.
    CallClosures InstrCallClosures
  | TailCallClosures InstrCallClosures
  | -- | Pushes the top of the current value stack on top of the calling function
    -- value stack, discards the current activation frame, transfers control to
    -- the address at the top of the global call stack, and pops the call stack.
    -- JVA opcode: 'ret'.

data Opcode

    -- result. JVA opcode: 'sub'.

    -- result. JVA opcode 'mul'.

    -- result. JVA opcode: 'le'.

    -- by two, and push the result. JVA opcode: 'eq'.
