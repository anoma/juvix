--- Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces
--- in a three-by-three grid with X or O.
---
--- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or
--- diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
---
--- The function ;run; contains the game logic.
