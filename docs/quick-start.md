To install Juvix, follow the instructions in the [Installation
How-to](./howto/installing.md).

After installation, run `juvix --help` to see the list of commands.

Run Juvix doctor to check your system setup:

```shell
juvix doctor
```

## CLI Usage Examples

Create a new package:

```shell
juvix init
```

Compile a source file into an executable:

```shell
juvix compile path/to/source.juvix
```

Compile a source file into a WebAssembly binary:

```shell
juvix compile -t wasm path/to/source.juvix
```

Launch the REPL:

```shell
juvix repl
```

Typecheck a source file:

```shell
juvix typecheck path/to/source.juvix
```

Generate HTML representations of a source file and its imports:

```shell
juvix html --recursive path/to/source.juvix
```

## The Hello World example

This is the Juvix source code of the traditional Hello World program.

```shell
-- HelloWorld.juvix
module HelloWorld;

open import Stdlib.Prelude;

main : IO;
main := printStringLn "hello world!";

end;
```

To compile and run a binary generated by Juvix, save the source code to
a file called `HelloWorld.juvix` and run the following command from the
directory containing it:

```shell
juvix compile HelloWorld.juvix
./HelloWorld
```

You should see the output: `hello world!`

The source code can also be compiled to a WebAssembly binary. This
requires some additional setup. See the [Installation
How-to](https://anoma.github.io/juvix/howto/installing.html) for more
information. You can also run `juvix doctor` to check your setup.

```shell
juvix compile --target wasm HelloWorld.juvix
wasmer HelloWorld.wasm
```
