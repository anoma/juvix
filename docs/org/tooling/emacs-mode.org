** Emacs Mode

There is an Emacs mode available for Juvix. Currently, it
supports syntax highlighting for well-scoped modules.

To install it add the following lines to your
Emacs configuration file:

#+begin_src elisp
(push "/path/to/juvix/juvix-mode/" load-path)
(require 'juvix-mode)
#+end_src

Make sure that Juvix is installed in your =PATH=.

The Juvix major mode will be activated automatically for =.juvix= files.

*** Keybindings

  | Key       | Function Name           | Description                                           |
  |-----------+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
  | =C-c C-l= | =juvix-load=            | Runs the scoper and adds semantic syntax highlighting |
  | =M-.=     | =juvix-goto-definition= | Go to the definition of symbol at point               |
  | =C-c C-f= | =juvix-format-buffer=   | Format the current buffer                             |

*** Emacs installation

Most Linux distributions contain an Emacs package which can be
installed with your package manager (=sudo apt install emacs= on
Ubuntu). On macOS, it is recommended to install Emacs Plus via
Homebrew: =brew install emacs-plus=. Using the Emacs Homebrew casks is
not recommended.

*** Common problems

- Error "Symbol's value as variable is void: sh:1:"

  Make sure the juvix executable is on the Emacs' =exec-path=. Note
  that =exec-path= may be different from your shell's =PATH=.  This is
  particularly common on macOS with Emacs launched from GUI instead of
  the terminal.

  The easiest way to resolve this issue is to install the
  [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]] package (available on MELPA). Alternatively,
  one may set =exec-path= to match shell =PATH= by following the
  instructions from [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ExecPath][EmacsWiki]].
