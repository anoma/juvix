** Emacs Mode


There is an Emacs mode available for Juvix. Currently, it
supports syntax highlighting for well-scoped modules.

To install it add the following lines to your Emacs configuration file:

#+begin_src elisp
(push "/path/to/juvix/juvix-mode/" load-path)
(require 'juvix-mode)
#+end_src

Make sure that Juvix is installed in your =PATH=.

The Juvix major mode will be activated automatically for =.juvix= files.
