* Control structures

** Case

A case expression has the following syntax:

#+begin_example
case value
| pat1 := branch1
..
| patN := branchN
#+end_example

For example, one can evaluate the following expression in the REPL:
#+begin_example
Stdlib.Prelude> case 1, 2 | suc _, zero := 0 | suc _, suc x := x | _ := 19
1
#+end_example

** Lazy builtins

The standard library provides several builtin functions which are treated specially and evaluated lazily. These builtins must always be fully applied.

- =if condition branch1 branch2=. First evaluates =condition=, if true evaluates and returns =branch1=, otherwise evaluates and returns =branch2=.
- =a || b=. Lazy disjunction. First evaluates =a=, if true returns true, otherwise evaluates and returns =b=.
- =a && b=. Lazy conjunction. First evaluates =a=, if false returns false, otherwise evaluates and returns =b=.
- =a >> b=. Sequences two IO actions. Lazy in the second argument.
