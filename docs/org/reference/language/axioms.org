* Axiom

Axioms or postulates can be introduced by using the =axiom= keyword.
For example, let us imagine one wants to write a program that assumes
$A$ is a type, and there exists a term $x$ that inhabits $A$. Then the program would look like the following.

#+begin_src
-- Example.juvix
module Example;
 axiom A : Type;
 axiom x : A;
end;
#+end_src

Terms introduced by the =axiom= keyword lack any computational content. Programs containing axioms not marked as builtins cannot be compiled to most targets.
