* Local definitions

Local definitions are introduced with the =let= construct.

#+begin_example
sum : NList -> Nat;
sum lst :=
  let
    go : Nat -> NList -> Nat;
    go acc nnil := acc;
    go acc (ncons x xs) := go (acc + x) xs;
  in
  go 0 lst;
#+end_example

The declaractions in a =let= have the same syntax as declarations inside a module, but they are visible only in the expression following the =in= keyword.
