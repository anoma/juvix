* Function declarations

A function declaration consists of a type signature and a group of /function clauses/.

In the following example, we define a function =multiplyByTwo=. The first
line =multiplyByTwo : Nat -> Nat;= is the type signature and the second line
~multiplyByTwo n := 2 * n;~ is a function clause.

#+begin_example
open import Stdlib.Prelude;

multiplyByTwo : Nat -> Nat;
multiplyByTwo n := 2 * n;
#+end_example

A function may have more than one function clause. When a function is called,
the first clause that matches the argument is used.

The following function has two clauses.

#+begin_example
open import Stdlib.Prelude;

neg : Bool -> Bool;
neg true := false;
neg false := true;
#+end_example

When =neg= is called with =true=, the first clause is used and the function
returns =false=. Similarly, when =neg= is called with =false=, the second clause
is used and the function returns =true=.

** Mutually recursive functions

Function declarations can depend on each other recursively. In the following example, we define a function that checks if a number is =even= by calling a function that checks if a number is =odd=.

#+begin_example
open import Stdlib.Prelude;

odd : Nat → Bool;

even : Nat → Bool;

odd zero := false;
odd (suc n) := even n;

even zero := true;
even (suc n) := odd n;
#+end_example
