* Foreign blocks

The =foreign= blocks give the developer the ability to introduce any piece of
code in the compiled file. In addition, every foreign block specifies the
backend's name that will include the given code in the body of the foreign
block.

The following is an example taken from the Juvix standard library.

#+begin_example
module Integers;
axiom Int : Type;
compile Int {  c -> "int" };

foreign c {
   bool lessThan(int l, int r) {
     return l < r;
   \}
};

type Bool :=
    true : Bool |
    false : Bool;

infix 4 <';
axiom <' : Int -> Int -> Bool;
compile <' {
  c -> "lessThan";
};
#+end_example
