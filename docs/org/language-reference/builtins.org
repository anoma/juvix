* Built-ins

Juvix has support for the built-in natural type and a few functions that are compiled to efficient primitives.

1. Built-in inductive definitions.

   #+begin_example
   builtin natural
   inductive Nat {
     zero : Nat;
     suc : Nat → Nat;
   };
   #+end_example

2. Builtin function definitions.

   #+begin_example
   inifl 6 +;
   builtin natural-plus
   + : Nat → Nat → Nat;
   + zero b ≔ b;
   + (suc a) b ≔ suc (a + b);
   #+end_example

3. Builtin axiom definitions.

   #+begin_example
   builtin natural-print
   axiom printNat : Nat → Action;
   #+end_example
